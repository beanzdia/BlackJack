During this project, I learned how to create novel classes completely independently (compared to with extensive guidance on the assessments). 
I enjoyed creating a baseline functioning code and continually improving it and adding more features to make it more interesting and more representative of the real game. 
I found it to be challenging to write code separate from my partners that still worked with their code and did not overlap in functionality. In that same vein, I found it challenging to fully understand all of my partners code so that I could adapt my own to theirs. I found youtube tutorials to be very helpful for my understanding of creating a GUI and I found answers to many questions on Stack Overflow.

This project helped me learn a lot about java programming. I was able to spend a lot of time studying game development, GUI design, and object oriented programming. Blackjack is a simple card game, but it was a great programming project because it allowed us to use CSE 143 topics that we could all contribute to. It has always been my goal growing up around technology to create my own computer program similar to an executable file on my desktop. 
I learned how to achieve that through using Java’s swing, graphics, and mouseevent packages. I enjoyed being able to spend hours studying from online tutorials, YouTube videos, and other resources on a topic that I was engaged and seriously interested in. I feel that I am leaving the class with new skills and an improved understanding of what programming can accomplish. It was challenging getting started to even write and share code. The Ed workspace was very limited in what it could offer. 
I don’t have much experience using the terminal, github, or Java IDEs. I spent a lot of time trying to find the right IDE for me (IntelliJ) and being able to share code with others. Another issue was that I felt there wasn’t enough time to complete the actual coding of the project. A lot of time was focused on idea exploration and whittling down the ideas to a feasible project that only a week and a half was allowed for significant project focused coding. I found the online resources available to be very helpful. 
I spent a lot of time studying sample code from other projects such as a ping-pong and text adventure game to understand the appropriate approach for our project. The TAs also were very helpful in recommending IDEs and troubleshooting github/terminal issues.

I learned how to work under pressure, especially since I joined the group very late. I also learned how to read and build off of other people’s code in a short amount of time, which was a stressful but enjoyable experience for me. I enjoyed being able to make a presentation and write a storyboard for our user guide video, as well as try my best in the short amount of time of time I had to get the split hand function working. 
Probably working on everything I worked on in under a week was the most challenging, but again because I joined late, there is not much more I can say for the rest of the project. I found my teammates, TA’s, and staff very helpful for this project, everyone was very helpful and understanding, it was something I really appreciated.
