The thought process when creating this program was to create a hierarchy to create an instance of a game, where a game consists of a Player which will have a deck, made up of cards, with cards being the most basic class of the program.

A card is represented by a string of its suit (Spades, Clubs, Hearts, and Diamonds) and by a rank. Each rank consists of a string of its symbol (ex: King) and an integer value. 

We chose to create such a rank because not every card display is a straightforward value. For example, King, Queen, and Jack are all worth 10. Additionally, an Ace can be worth 1 or 11, so implementing this ranking system allowed us to later implement a choice between 1 or 11.

A deck consists of 52 cards, with one card of each rank for each suit. We used a random object to randomly select cards when building a deck. We also used a random object to select a card from that deck. After a card draw, we used a remove function to take the card out of the current deck being used, so that it can’t be drawn again. This functionality simulates real life game play, where each game begins with a shuffled deck of 52 cards and cards are not replenished when cards are drawn within the game. 

A player is represented by several main components: an integer of funds, an integer bid, hand of cards, and a deck. The funds are updated each game, depending on whether the player won or lost. Additionally, the amount of funds determined how much a player could bid and whether they could play at all. The integer bid, when controlled from the GUI, could be 1, 10, 100, or 1000 to represent chips. The hand of cards begins as empty for the start of each game, and is added to one card at a time. This structure makes it easy to add cards to a hand, whether it is for the initial deal or for hitting or for splitting. Last, a newly shuffled deck is created for the player for each new game. Associating a deck with the player class allows the program to keep track of what cards have been drawn.

The GamePlay class provides the structure for actually playing a class. It creates two players (one dealer and one user) and a new deck. Using the draw function (which returns a card) in the deck class and the add function in the player class, the dealer is initially dealt two cards, as is the user. Then the GUI prompts the user to hit or hold; If they hit then another card is dealt. Once the user has exceeded 21 or decides to hold, it is the dealer’s turn to draw. The dealer hit and user hit are different methods because the user hit requires user input and the dealer hit is based on predetermined logic. GamePlayer then prints the winner and determines the earnings based on a series of checks, using if else statements. If the dealer hand is less than 21 and is greater than the user’s, or if the user’s hand exceeds 21, then the dealer wins and the user loses the amount of their bid. If the inverse is true then the user wins and gains the amount of their bid. If the hands are equal then it is considered a push and the user neither gains nor loses money.
